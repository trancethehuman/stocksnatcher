# Stock Snatcher!
## A quick project to keep myself from going on my trading platform 20 times a day just to check some prices and news

## What is this?
Stock Snatcher is a JavaScript program that presents stock price data in a presentable manner (a JS graph, some news and memes)
and has a simple HTML layout.

## What comes after this?
I'm making a 2.0 version of this, complete with pretty CSS and such, and may possibly even host it online! How cool (and unimpressive to the
experienced developers out there).
